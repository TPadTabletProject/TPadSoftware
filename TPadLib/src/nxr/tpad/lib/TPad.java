/**
 * This interface provides the basic TPad functions
 * <p>
 * All TPad enabled Android Applications must use this class to interface with the TPad. The TPad itself is managed through the usage of the {@link TPadService}, which runs in the background and
 * manages the connection of the phone to the TPad electronics board.
 * 
 * Typical usage:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * (Load TPad on startup)
 * TPad tpad = new TPadImpl(this);
 * 
 * (Set friction value to half total value)
 * tpad.sendFriction(0.5f);
 * 
 * (disconnect TPad when activity is destroyed)
 * tpad.disconnectTPad();
 *

	 * <p>
	 * Note that a value of 1 will turn the TPad on to full power, so be careful leaving the screen on for long periods of time, or when the user is not touching the screen.
	 * 
	 * @param f
	 *            Friction level to be output to the screen. 1 corresponds to lowest friction possible (slipperiest screen, turns TPad fully on) 0 corresponds to highest friction possible (stickiest
	 *            screen, turns TPad off!) Any value in-between 0 and 1 will be proportionally sticky or slippery

	 * Same as {@link #sendFriction(float f)}, but with a large buffer of friction values. Friction values will be played back to the TPad at a rate of {@link TPadService.OUTPUT_SAMPLE_RATE}.
	 * <p>
	 * For example: For a TPad that is playing back values at 6250 Hz, an array of 625 values will be played for 100 mS. The internal {@link #TPadService} buffer can, however, only hold enough data to
	 * be played back for 1 second. For longer playback times, send data to the Service in chunks of less than a second.
	 * <p>
	 * For best user experience, it is recommended to send data to the TPad as fast as possible. Therefore, you should send friction buffer chunks to the TPad every 10mS or so.

	 * is turned off.
	 * <p>
	 * The type of stimulus this gives to the user is, in general, very similar to the onboard vibration motor that is common in most phones. With the TPad, however, this stimulus is felt directly on
	 * the fingertip, and not throughout the entire phone.
	 * <p>
	 * In general, this type of feedback is NOT what the TPad is specifically designed for, but it is possible to do. In most cases, it is recommended you use the TPad to change overall friction value
